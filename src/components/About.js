				<p>
					Technology has been a big part of my life. As a kid, I would get so
					intrigued by designs, functionality, and content on websites that I
					would visit. I often found myself wondering how these websites were
					created and wanted to be able to build them myself and thus began my
					long journey into becoming a developer. So far this experience has
					been amazing and I have picked up a lot of skills along the way.
